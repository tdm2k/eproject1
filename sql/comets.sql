Its predictable return every 75-76 years has allowed for meticulous tracking across millennia, with documented sightings by Chinese astronomers as early as 240 BCE. Its appearance has often been intertwined with major historical events, famously depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry in 1066. English astronomer Edmond Halley was the first to recognize that comets observed in 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same object, successfully predicting its return in 1758. When it last visited in 1986, it was met by an international fleet of spacecraft, including Giotto, which provided the first close-up images of a comet nucleus, revealing its dark, potato-shaped form. Its next eagerly anticipated return is in 2061.','../assets/images/comets/Lspn_comet_halley.jpg',3),(2,'C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp','Exceptionally bright and visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months; featured two distinct and prominent tails; one of the largest cometary nuclei observed.','1997-04-01',2533,'Discovered independently by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp on July 23, 1995, Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) rapidly became one of the most anticipated and spectacular celestial events of the late 20th century. Its immense brightness, sustained for a remarkable 18 months, was attributed to its unusually large nucleus, estimated to be about 60 kilometers in diameter. Observers were captivated by its two prominent tails: a broad, yellowish dust tail composed of small solid particles, and a distinct blue ion tail, made of ionized gas blown directly away from the Sun by the solar wind. Hale-Bopp reached its perihelion on April 1, 1997, and became a true \"Great Comet,\" widely photographed and admired by millions worldwide. Its long orbital period means it will not return for another 2,500 years, making its 1997 apparition a once-in-a-lifetime event for most.','../assets/images/comets/Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg',3),(3,'D/1993 F2 Shoemaker-Levy 9','Famously fragmented into numerous pieces before a spectacular collision with Jupiter in 1994; provided the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial impact in the Solar System.','1994-07-22',0,'Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (D/1993 F2) is unique in astronomical history due to its dramatic demise. Discovered in 1993 by Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and David Levy, the comet was found to be already fractured into more than 20 distinct pieces, resembling a \"string of pearls.\" This fragmentation was caused by a close encounter with Jupiter\'s immense gravitational field in 1992. In July 1994, these fragments sequentially plunged into Jupiter\'s atmosphere, creating a series of colossal impacts. These collisions were meticulously observed by telescopes worldwide, including the Hubble Space Telescope, providing unprecedented insights into the dynamics of planetary impacts and the composition of Jupiter\'s lower atmosphere. The dark scars left on Jupiter\'s cloud tops, some larger than Earth, were visible for months, serving as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of our solar system.','../assets/images/comets/images-levy.jpg',3),(4,'C/2006 P1 McNaught','The brightest comet observed in the last 40 years; boasted an incredibly long, feathery dust tail and was visible in daylight around its perihelion.','2007-01-12',92600,'Comet McNaught (C/2006 P1), discovered by Robert H. McNaught on August 7, 2006, became a spectacular sight in early 2007, earning the title \"The Great Comet of 2007.\" As it approached perihelion on January 12, 2007, it became so bright that it was briefly visible in broad daylight from parts of the Southern Hemisphere. Its most striking feature was its magnificent, fan-shaped dust tail, which stretched across an enormous expanse of the sky, estimated to be tens of millions of kilometers long and exhibiting complex striations and bands. While not as widely seen in the Northern Hemisphere, its stunning appearance for those in the south cemented its place as one of the brightest and most beautiful comets of recent times, truly a masterpiece of cosmic artistry.','../assets/images/comets/Comet_P1_McNaught02_-_23-01-07.jpg',3),(5,'C/2020 F3 NEOWISE','The brightest naked-eye comet in the Northern Hemisphere since 1997; known for its two distinct tails (dust and ion) and captivating visibility during the summer of 2020.','2020-07-23',6800,'Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3), discovered by the NEOWISE space telescope on March 27, 2020, unexpectedly brightened to become a captivating naked-eye object in the Northern Hemisphere during July 2020. Its timely appearance provided a much-needed celestial spectacle during a challenging global period. NEOWISE exhibited two prominent tails: a broad, yellowish dust tail, curving gently due to the comet\'s orbital motion and the Sun\'s radiation pressure, and a thinner, bluish ion tail, pointing directly away from the Sun, shaped by the solar wind. Passing closest to Earth on July 23, 2020, NEOWISE was widely photographed by amateur and professional astronomers alike, becoming a viral phenomenon and a memorable astronomical highlight for millions who gazed upwards during those summer nights.','../assets/images/comets/Comet_Neowise_C-2020_F3.jpg',3),(13,'C/1996 B2 Hyakutake','Known for its extremely long and bright tail, visible in 1996; one of the closest cometary approaches to Earth in 200 years.','1996-03-25',70000,'Comet Hyakutake (C/1996 B2), discovered in January 1996 by Yuji Hyakutake, became a \"Great Comet\" of the 1990s, offering a spectacular view in the night sky. Its incredibly long tail, spanning up to 80 degrees across the sky, was a breathtaking sight for observers in the Northern Hemisphere. It made an exceptionally close approach to Earth, just 15 million kilometers away, allowing for detailed scientific observations. Data from the Ulysses spacecraft, which unexpectedly crossed its tail, revealed its immense length, extending over 500 million kilometers. Hyakutake provided valuable insights into cometary composition and behavior, particularly its X-ray emission, which was a surprising discovery at the time. Its next visit is not expected for tens of thousands of years.','../assets/images/comets/Comet-Hyakutake.jpg',3),(14,'C/1965 S1 Ikeya-Seki','A very bright \"Sungrazer\" comet in 1965, briefly visible in daylight; fragmented upon close approach to the Sun.','1965-10-21',880,'Comet Ikeya-Seki (C/1965 S1), discovered independently by Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki in September 1965, rapidly evolved into one of the most brilliant comets of the 20th century. Classified as a \"Sungrazer\" due to its extremely close approach to the Sun, it reached a dazzling magnitude of -10 at its perihelion, making it briefly visible in broad daylight. This incredible brightness was accompanied by fragmentation of its nucleus as it skimmed the solar corona. Although its daylight visibility was short-lived, its appearance just before dawn and after dusk, with a long, bright tail, captivated millions and provided invaluable data on cometary interactions with the Sun. Its next return is estimated to be over 800 years away.','../assets/images/comets/images-seki.jpg',3),(15,'C/1975 V1 West','A \"Great Comet\" of 1976, known for its distinct striated dust tail and bright appearance; one of the last great naked-eye comets before Hale-Bopp.','1976-02-25',254000,'Comet West (C/1975 V1), discovered by Richard West in 1975, was another magnificent \"Great Comet,\" becoming a stunning sight in early 1976. Despite being initially overlooked, it unexpectedly brightened significantly after its perihelion passage, reaching a magnitude of -3. Its most notable feature was its highly structured and beautifully striated dust tail, which appeared to split into four distinct filaments. This intricate tail structure provided a visual feast for observers and offered unique data on the expulsion of dust from a cometary nucleus. Comet West served as a reminder of the unpredictable brilliance of comets, a true gem for astronomers and the public alike before the age of widespread astrophotography and internet sharing.','../assets/images/comets/C-west-1976-ps.jpg',3),(16,'2P/Encke','Shortest known orbital period (3.3 years) of any named comet; extensively studied and linked to the Taurid meteor shower.','2023-10-22',3.3,'Comet Encke (2P/Encke) holds the distinction of having the shortest orbital period of any named comet, completing a circuit around the Sun every 3.3 years. Discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1786 and later recognized as a periodic comet by Johann Franz Encke, its frequent returns have made it one of the most studied comets. It is famously associated with the Taurid meteor shower, observed annually in October and November, as Earth passes through the debris stream left by the comet. Despite its frequent visits, Encke is not typically a naked-eye object, requiring binoculars or telescopes for observation. Its regular apparitions continue to provide scientists with invaluable data on cometary evolution and the dynamics of meteoroid streams.','../assets/images/comets/messenger-comet-2p-encke.jpg',3),(17,'C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy','A bright, long-period comet visible to the naked eye in 2015; known for its distinct green coma due to diatomic carbon emission.','2015-01-30',8000,'Comet Lovejoy (C/2014 Q2), discovered by Terry Lovejoy in August 2014, offered a delightful naked-eye viewing opportunity in early 2015, particularly for Southern Hemisphere observers. As it approached perihelion, it developed a prominent green glow in its coma, a common but visually striking phenomenon caused by the emission of diatomic carbon (C2) molecules fluorescing in sunlight. The comet also displayed a noticeable tail and was a favorite target for astrophotographers. Its relatively bright appearance and distinct color made it a popular object for public observation, contributing to renewed interest in cometary astronomy during its brief, spectacular visit to the inner solar system. Its next return is not anticipated for many thousands of years.','../assets/images/comets/C2014_Q2.jpg',3);
